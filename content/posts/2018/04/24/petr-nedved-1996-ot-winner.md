Twelve years ago today [Petr Nedved][url-ref] scored his second goal of the game 4 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals at 19:15 mark of the fourth overtime to give the Pittsburgh Penguins a 3-2 victory against the Washington Capitals. It was an absolutely bonkers game with a penalty shot, unexpected goalie changes, etc. Also, Pittsburg has been frustrating Washington in the playoffs for a long time and the two will meet again in the 2nd round for a 3rd consecutive season.
