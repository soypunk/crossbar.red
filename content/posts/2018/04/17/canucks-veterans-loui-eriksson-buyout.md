[Canucks veterans][url-ref] unlikely to return. As a commentor notes (and as was covered on a recent _"[Bobcast][]"_) - a buy out of Loui Eriksson's contract is unlikely as it would essentially cost the Canucks the same amount to pay him as it would as a cap penalty. Hopefully Loui's got a better season or two left in him.
