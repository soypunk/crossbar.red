A [video][url-ref] of [Brett Connolly][bconnolly8] making sure a young female fan gets a puck has been making the rounds today. Brett had tried to get the puck to her but (presumably) the kid's Dad kept catching the pucks and handing them to her older brothers like a jerk. Connolly, a former first round pick of the Tampa Bay Lightning, does a nice job of showing why NHL players are the nicest folks in pro sports.
