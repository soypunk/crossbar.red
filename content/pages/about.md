Crossbar is written and produced by Shawn Medero out of Claremont, California, United States.

I try to post daily tidbits about hockey pulling from a variety of sources and with no particular focus. 

For purposes of noting biases:

* I'm a Tampa Bay Lightning fan first and foremost
* Before Tampa had a team I grew up as a Vancouver Canucks fan because those 80s & 90s jerseys were bad ass
* Now that I live in Southern California I also like the Los Angeles Kings because their Twitter account makes the best use of the platform
