NBC Sports broadcasted today's Devils @ Lightning playoff game and managed to completely ignore that one team (Tampa) was missing a defenseman (Girardi) for the third period. I guess "entertainment" and narrative are more important to NBC Sports than the reporting and broadcasting portion of a sporting event.
