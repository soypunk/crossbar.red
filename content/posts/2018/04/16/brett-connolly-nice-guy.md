A [video][url-ref] of [Brett Connolly][bconnolly8] making sure a young female fan gets a puck has been making the rounds today. Brett had tried to get the puck to her but (presumably) the kid's Dad (nope, see update) kept catching the pucks and handing them to her older brothers (nope, see update) like a jerk. Connolly, a former first round pick of the Tampa Bay Lightning, does a nice job of showing why NHL players are the nicest folks in pro sports. **Update:** Turns out the kid, [Keelan Moxley][1], didn't even know the two boys or the adult taking the pucks from her. Jerk label still applies to adult male.
